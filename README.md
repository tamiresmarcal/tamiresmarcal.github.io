# Computational Neuroscientists working for a better future
I am a neuroscience researcher and data scientist with a decade of experience bridging brain science and machine learning. With a strong background in science communication, industry collaboration, and open science, I am passionate about building tools that bring research closer to real-world solutions. I am currently pursuing a PhD at McGill University in the Integrated Program in Neuroscience at the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) and Montreal Institute for Learning Algorithms (MILA). I explore how the brain predicts and responds to real-world stimuli, combining predictive modeling, neuroimaging, and AI.
